# Category Theory Notebook

The following is a not-exhaustive list of notes that I took while I was reading multiple articles and posts and books on Category Theory. At the end of this notebook, you will find the references, from which I took the notes.

Happy reading!

## Why should I learn Category Theory as a programmer / developer

The basic idea behind category theory is composition. The composition is the concept behind every programming paradigm. We compose procedures, objects or functions. We need to compose because we need to decompose difficult structures to manage complexity.

In functional programming, we compose functions, but also "concurrency", which means we can treat the concurrency execution of programs as an object that can be composed. This is a _killer feature_, because of the multicore hardware revolution.
